## ⚠️ Areas for Ongoing Improvement

### 1. Dynamic Content Announcements

**Current State:** Some dynamic content updates may not be announced to screen readers

**Recommendations:**
- Add `aria-live` regions for toast notifications
- Add `role="status"` for loading states
- Add `role="alert"` for error messages

**Example:**
```tsx
<div role="status" aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
  {isLoading && "Loading invoice data..."}
</div>
```

### 2. Data Tables

**Current State:** Tables exist but may need enhanced accessibility

**Recommendations:**
- Add `<caption>` elements
- Ensure `scope` attributes on headers
- Add `aria-sort` for sortable columns

**Example:**
```tsx
<table>
  <caption>Customer List</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" aria-sort="ascending">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Email</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>
```

### 3. Error Handling in Forms

**Current State:** Error toast notifications, need inline association

**Recommendations:**
- Add `aria-describedby` linking to error messages
- Add `aria-invalid="true"` when field has error
- Move focus to first error on submission

**Example:**
```tsx
<Input
  id="email"
  aria-invalid={!!error}
  aria-describedby={error ? "email-error" : undefined}
/>
{error && (
  <span id="email-error" role="alert" className="text-red-500">
    {error}
  </span>
)}
```

### 4. Loading States

**Current State:** Visual loading indicators present

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all loading states are announced
- Use `aria-busy` attribute
- Provide meaningful loading text

**Example:**
```tsx
<div aria-busy={isLoading} aria-live="polite">
  {isLoading ? "Loading..." : data}
</div>
```

### 5. Additional Dashboard Modals

**Current State:** Main modals improved, others need audit

**To Review:**
- [ ] EditCustomerModal
- [ ] DeleteCustomerModal
- [ ] CreateInvoiceModal
- [ ] EditInvoiceModal
- [ ] InvoiceViewModal
- [ ] DeleteInvoiceModal
- [ ] TakePaymentModal
- [ ] RefundModal
- [ ] BusinessProfileModal
- [ ] PaymentSettingsModal
- [ ] PreferencesModal
- [ ] All Settings modals

**Apply Same Patterns:**
- Unique IDs for all form controls
- Proper fieldsets and legends
- Required field indicators
- Autocomplete attributes
- Submit on Enter
- Descriptive button labels
